**What Are My Interests?**

My interests in IT come from a range of sources, from being around technology and computers from a very young age and growing up with emerging tech and industry. I feel as though the next big tech jump will come from our generation. 

**Who Am I** 

I originally come from the Netherlands, was raised in England until aroun 13 years old then moved here to be closer to family, i was raised around technology and what sparked my curiosity in Tech and gaming was a series known as Call of Duty, i would play it every chance i got as a small child, this was the starting point to me owning every game i could find and get. Then when Medal of Hounor and Battlefield came into the light i played all of them, i now own every MOH and BAttlefield title ever made, yes, even Battlefield free to play. 

Although my knowledge of games is large, my knowledge of how they work and how other systems work is something i have yet to discover, this is the main reason i'm doing this course, so that i may build knowledge of how different systems opperate and then be able to modify/ improve them. I plan on finding a job within the Cyber Security side of things as i believe as the world becomes more digital it also becomes more vulnerable.

#### Myer Briggs Test Results

The test i took to uncover my personality was actually very suprising for me, is outlined a bunch of questions i had yet to answer and made me think about myself. The results were as follows 

"ADVENTURER"   Mind: 79% introverted  Energy: 55% Observant  Nature: 54% Feeling  Tactics: 60% Prospecting  Identity: 54% Assertive 

These results made me realise im very introverted and i like to be by myself alot, I should try in future to socialize more.
The results will impact my ability to interract witht the group i work with, i will need to step out of my comfort zone in order to complete some tasks.

#### Learning Style Test

My learning style test cae back with me being a 55% Visual learner, This did not suprise me as throughout my school life i have always done poorly with theory lessons, such as Business studies, All Business studies was were a wall of text for me, it made no sense because i couldnt just look at it and figure it out, i had to see it happening but that wasnt possible. Unlike Business studies, Biology and AGriculture class were my best classes, i had plenty of practicle lessons which allowed me to understand what we were talking about and how it was implimented. 
These results may impact the way i work in a team by only being able to understand certain topics if someone can show me what they mean or how they work, im sre i will be able to manage most challenges i will face, but as things get more complicated i might need someone to show me how to do something, such as a youtube video or diagram.

#### Creativity Test
As the third test was to be unique, i decided to go with a creativity test, this allowed me to see what i was like compared to other people, it turned out i have a creativity score of 55.44% whereas most people lay in the 63% region, although my test came back with a high complexity reasoning for creativity, it meant that i always question what else i can do after i have completed the original task, wether or not i can improve it or add another part to the task.

This may impact the way i handle the group task in a way that im not quite sure, it may let me think what the group can do to imprve the overall presentation or it may hinder the progress as i try to think if we can improve something that may not even need improving, it will be intereting to see what happens.

#### Ideal Job

My ideal job would eventually be a cyber security consultant, With this role i would be able to gain skill in an expanding market, as more things get digital, more of the world becomes accessible to people with bad intentions.

The role of security consultant would provide my life long dream of becoming a Federal police officer with the combination of using advanced technology, Crimefighting has always been a passion of mine and i have always been decent with technology, if i am able to make this happen it would mean the world to me.

### Requirments for the role

The job requires alot of different qualifications, a few are listed below

1.  Vulnerability testing, risk analyses and security assesments on networks.

2. Responding to security breaches (unauthorized access, modification/distruction) 

3. Develop security protocols for businesses, research and recommend updates for previous systems.
