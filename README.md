My interests in IT come from a range of sources, from being around technology and computers from a very young age and growing up with emerging tech and industry. I feel as though the next big tech jump will come from our generation.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/AlexLoos20/-1-First-Assignment-2019/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
