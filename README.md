**What Are My Interests?**

My interests in IT come from a range of sources, from being around technology and computers from a very young age and growing up with emerging tech and industry. I feel as though the next big tech jump will come from our generation. 

**Who Am I** 

I originally come from the Netherlands, was raised in England until around 13 years old then moved here to be closer to family, i was raised around technology and what sparked my curiosity in Tech and gaming was a series known as Call of Duty, i would play it every chance i got as a small child, this was the starting point to me owning every game i could find and get. Then when Medal of Hounor and Battlefield came into the light i played all of them, i now own every MOH and BAttlefield title ever made, yes, even Battlefield free to play. 

Although my knowledge of games is large, my knowledge of how they work and how other systems work is something i have yet to discover, this is the main reason i'm doing this course, so that i may build knowledge of how different systems opperate and then be able to modify/ improve them. I plan on finding a job within the Cyber Security side of things as i believe as the world becomes more digital it also becomes more vulnerable.

#### Myer Briggs Test Results

The test i took to uncover my personality was actually very suprising for me, is outlined a bunch of questions i had yet to answer and made me think about myself. The results were as follows 

"ADVENTURER"   Mind: 79% introverted  Energy: 55% Observant  Nature: 54% Feeling  Tactics: 60% Prospecting  Identity: 54% Assertive 

These results made me realise im very introverted and i like to be by myself alot, I should try in future to socialize more.
The results will impact my ability to interract witht the group i work with, i will need to step out of my comfort zone in order to complete some tasks.

#### Learning Style Test

My learning style test cae back with me being a 55% Visual learner, This did not suprise me as throughout my school life i have always done poorly with theory lessons, such as Business studies, All Business studies was were a wall of text for me, it made no sense because i couldnt just look at it and figure it out, i had to see it happening but that wasnt possible. Unlike Business studies, Biology and AGriculture class were my best classes, i had plenty of practicle lessons which allowed me to understand what we were talking about and how it was implimented. 
These results may impact the way i work in a team by only being able to understand certain topics if someone can show me what they mean or how they work, im sre i will be able to manage most challenges i will face, but as things get more complicated i might need someone to show me how to do something, such as a youtube video or diagram.

#### Creativity Test
As the third test was to be unique, i decided to go with a creativity test, this allowed me to see what i was like compared to other people, it turned out i have a creativity score of 55.44% whereas most people lay in the 63% region, although my test came back with a high complexity reasoning for creativity, it meant that i always question what else i can do after i have completed the original task, wether or not i can improve it or add another part to the task.

This may impact the way i handle the group task in a way that im not quite sure, it may let me think what the group can do to imprve the overall presentation or it may hinder the progress as i try to think if we can improve something that may not even need improving, it will be intereting to see what happens.

#### Ideal Job

My ideal job would eventually be a cyber security consultant, With this role i would be able to gain skill in an expanding market, as more things get digital, more of the world becomes accessible to people with bad intentions.

The role of security consultant would provide my life long dream of becoming a Federal police officer with the combination of using advanced technology, Crimefighting has always been a passion of mine and i have always been decent with technology, if i am able to make this happen it would mean the world to me.

### Requirments for the role

The job requires alot of different qualifications, a few are listed below

1.  Vulnerability testing, risk analyses and security assesments on networks.

2. Responding to security breaches (unauthorized access, modification/distruction) 

3. Develop security protocols for businesses, research and recommend updates for previous systems.

### Current Skills and Qualifications 

Unfortunatley i dont have any of these skills yet and no knowledge on security sytems or how they work. My plan is to use this course as a gateway into cyber security and find a suitable course for the role, it will take a few years but in the end i should be able to achive what i want.

**Project Time**

### Overview

For the project i am creating an automatic farm in minecraft, it will be a very rough outline in the point i will try to convey. The automatic farm will be a sugarcane cutter with a hopper feed into a chest that stores the cut sugar cane, it will include some "redstone" blocks that act as computers of sorts and multiple " redstone repeaters" that would be timers in real life. 
The way that the computers would run in real life would be completely different as there is alot of programming involved for making sure the robot doing the harvesting is picking the correct time to harvest and not doing it too early or late, an additional program the robot could have would be the installation of an auto weeder (which already exists [Anatis autonomous weeder]) however, this would be too difficult the portray within minecraft and would almost be impossible.

### Motivation

The motivation for this project comes with my interest in Agriculture and computers, i believe that one day we will be able to utilize more and more technology for farming purposes and eventually have completely automated farms in the near future. At this point in time (2019) we already have self driving tractors and harvesters, these top end companies such as CASE and New Holland have these such technology on board. Having ridden in one of these machines it is so interesting to watch how the computer can sense the density of the soil underneath the tires and also keeping in the rows of the lane as to not damage crops.

### Description


![Minecraft Screenshot 2019 06 14 - 15 56 36 40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51146281/59486646-5951b180-8ebd-11e9-9455-cff5ef384c08.png)


Above is the screen cap of the projeect itself made within minecraft, it is a simple automatic system utilizing only a few materials. As it is impossible the create a computer within the game to identify a grown item i had to make a continuous sweeper arm that sweeps the sugar cane at a certain level. The red blocks on the screen are in place of a computer. 
At the moment there is a small demand for autonmous farming equipment as the people who generally manage the farm do not trust technology with multimillion dollar crops, but as recent studies have shown, the demand for robotics is rising and eventually will be adopted into every industry, robot have been used for making cars and other products for some time but it is only recently that the technology is being taken seriously by other industries, farming being one of them, as it is easier and somewhat cheaper to purchase a robot that can have multiple differetn algorythems given to it and for it to be able to execute the algorythem perfectly everytime it does it hich reduces the need for unskilled workers to be trained and shown how to use different machiens.
This automatic harvester built within the game allows the player to go and do other things without the need of standing around waiting for litteral grass to grow, it would allow people in realy life to leave the robot running and only going to service it once in a while, saving time for other activities which are more important.
